##### The ingredients needed to make Cinnamon Chocolate Christmas cookies:

1. Take 1 package Pillsbury Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough
1. Take 1 tbsp ground cinnamon
1. Take 1 stick butter


In fact, the batches I make ahead for my family and store in the freezer until Christmas seem to mysteriously disappear each yearâ€”even though the chocolate topping I put on before serving hasn&#39;t been. Instructions While the cookies are baking, go ahead and make the filling. Whisk together the sugar, butter, cinnamon and cream until nice and fluffy. You want the filling to be thick enough that it doesn&#39;t &#34;ooze&#34; out the sides of the cookies after they are filled, so if you need to add more powdered sugar, do so, one tablespoon at a time.
