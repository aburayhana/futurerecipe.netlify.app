These will continue to dry out as they cool. You can either leave them on the baking sheet or transfer them onto a wire rack to cool. Store in an airtight container and these will last a couple of weeks."
- "Once biscotti is cooled, you can melt some chocolate, dip and decorate with your favorite toppings!"
