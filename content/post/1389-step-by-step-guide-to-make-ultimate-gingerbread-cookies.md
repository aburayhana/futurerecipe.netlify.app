Hello everybody, it is me, Dave, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, gingerbread cookies. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Gingerbread Cookie Mix layered in a one quart canning jar. Place a circle of gingerbread fabric between lid and ring and tie a gingerbread man cookie cutter onto jar with ribbon! Sift the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, cloves, salt and pepper through a wire sieve into. Cut out cookies with desired cutter-- the ginger bread man is our favorite of course.

##### The ingredients needed to make gingerbread cookies:

1. Make ready 1 cup butter
1. Get 1 1/2 cup sugar
1. Make ready 1 egg
1. Prepare 2 tbsp dark corn syrup
1. Prepare 1 tbsp molasses

If you add too much sugar to the gingerbread mixture and then add icing, you&#39;re double-handling and they&#39;ll be quite sickly. Crisp gingerbread cookies have their place, of course, but sometimes, you want to soften them up a little bit, don&#39;t you? These tender cookies are the perfect fix for that craving, combining the classic spice flavors we all love and a chewy crumb that just about melts in your mouth. Combine the flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well.
