recipeingredient:
- "1 pack (.25 ounce) active dry yeast"
- "1/4 cup warm water"
- "3 1/2 cup bleached allpurpose flour"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "1 cup butter sliced"
- "3/4 cup sour cream"
- "1 large egg"
- "2 large egg yolks"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 cup white sugar or add as needed"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a bowl and let activate while you complete remaining steps."
- "Place flour and salt into a food processor and pulse once or twice to combine. Scatter butter slices over flour and process until butter is thoroughly mixed into the flour, about 1 minute."
- "Whisk yeast mixture, sour cream, egg, egg yolks, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; pour mixture into food processor. Pulse several times, just until the dough starts to hold together and clean the sides of the bowl (do not overmix)."
- "Remove dough from food processor and divide in half; form each half into a thick disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 2 hours. For best texture, refrigerate overnight."
- "Preheat oven to 375°F (190 degrees C). Line several baking sheets with parchment paper. Sprinkle a work surface generously with sugar and roll out one of the dough disks into an 8x16-inch rectangle."
- "Sprinkle dough with a generous amount of sugar. Fold the dough over in thirds, letter-style, and roll out again; fold as before and roll out and fold a third time, sprinkling dough with sugar each time."
- "Finally, roll dough into a 4x14-inch rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick. Repeat process with second dough disk."
- "Cut strips from the short side of the dough rectangles, making them 1/2 to 3/4 inch wide. Place strips onto the parchment-lined baking sheets, twisting and slightly stretching them. If preferred, form into horseshoe shapes."
- "Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Cookies will puff up a bit to reveal delicate layers. Let cookies cool for about 5 minutes on sheets before transferring to wire cooling racks"
