Gingerbread Cake &#34;This dark moist cake combines the old-fashioned flavors of ginger and molasses,&#34; says Ila Alderman of Galax, Virginia. &#34;The recipe was passed down to me from a dear aunt.&#34; Gingerbread Cake Recipe photo by Taste of Home Glazed Gingerbread Cake This is a favorite dessert during the holidays and at special occasions. I&#39;ve tried creating a glaze of some sort to drizzle over this moist, flavorful cake, but have found that it&#39;s delicious as is. In a large bowl, whisk together the oil, sugar, molasses,. This gingerbread recipe by itself is delicious (and totally acceptable to eat it as a stand-alone), but I just can&#39;t resist the combination of fresh bananas, whipped cream and the most amazing warm vanilla cream sauce drizzled on top.

There are many variations: from the darkest, densest cakes made with robust molasses and stout beer to the lightest, most delicate cakes flavored only with brown sugar and a hint of ground ginger. This gingerbread, handsdown, is the best I&#39;ve ever tasted. It turned out moist and absolutely delish. I&#39;ve made it twice already and even those who swear they hate gingerbread say that this is to die for.
