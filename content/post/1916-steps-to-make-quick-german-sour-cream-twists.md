recipeinstructions:
- "Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a bowl and let activate while you complete remaining steps."

- "Finally, roll dough into a 4x14-inch rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick. Repeat process with second dough disk."
- "Cut strips from the short side of the dough rectangles, making them 1/2 to 3/4 inch wide. Place strips onto the parchment-lined baking sheets, twisting and slightly stretching them. If preferred, form into horseshoe shapes."
- "Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Cookies will puff up a bit to reveal delicate layers. Let cookies cool for about 5 minutes on sheets before transferring to wire cooling racks"
