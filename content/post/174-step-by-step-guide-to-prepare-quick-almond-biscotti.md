- "Turn the dough onto the baking sheet and divide it in half. Shape each half of dough into 2-9 1/2&#34; x 2&#34; logs about 3/4&#34; tall. Make sure to straighten them out smoothing the tops and sides. Sprinkle with sugar and gently pat it in."
- "Bake the biscotti for 25 minutes.  Remove from oven."
- "**Tip-When I take these out of the oven I like to take a spray bottle with room temperature water and spritz the sides and tops just lightly. This will soften your crust just a bit so that the biscoti slices easier.**"

These will continue to dry out as they cool. You can either leave them on the baking sheet or transfer them onto a wire rack to cool. Store in an airtight container and these will last a couple of weeks."
- "Once biscotti is cooled, you can melt some chocolate, dip and decorate with your favorite toppings!"
