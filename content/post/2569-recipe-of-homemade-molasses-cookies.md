Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until creamy. Add flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, salt and cloves; beat at low speed until well mixed. Molasses cookies are similar to gingersnap cookies when it comes to flavor. Both kinds of cookies are made with cinnamon, ginger and molasses, but molasses cookies are soft and chewy rather than crispy.
