This recipe for golden, chewy, date-and-walnut-packed bars comes from the Los Angeles pastry chef Margarita Manzke, who grew up in the Philippines and now runs the sweet side of the kitchen at République When she was in high school, Manzke came across the classic recipe for &#34;food for the gods&#34; in a thin pamphlet of Filipino desserts, and she made the bars again and again, learning how to.
