- "100 g 3 oz  cup sugar"
- "1 egg"
- "2 tsp ground ginger powder"

recipeinstructions:
- "Beat together the butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in the egg and Golden Syrup until the mixture is smooth.  Sift in the remainder of the ingredients and beat/mix to form a smooth dough."
- "Wrap the dough in plastic or place in a plastic bag. Let the dough chill in the ‘fridge for about an hour to firm up. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to about ¼” (6mm) thick.   Use a gingerbread man cutter to cut out the shapes. Place a piece of baking paper on a baking tray and arrange the shapes ready for baking. Leave at least ½” (1cm) between the shapes."
- "Bake at 180°C (350°F) for 10 minutes. Place on a wire rack to cool before decorating. Prepare the frosting: Sift the icing sugar into a bowl and gradually mix in the milk until you achieve a firm paste. Use a piping bag or syringe to decorate the shapes."
- "#Tips:  The initial dough should be quite firm – if it is too soft it will spread while cooking. If you find your dough is very soft simply sift in a tbsp or two of extra flour until you achieve the desired consistency.  While gingerbread men are traditional, you can make other shapes too depending upon what cookie-cutter shapes you have."
- "If you want to use different colours in decorating the shapes, simply take a portion of the frosting and mix in a drop or two of food colouring. You can also decorate with Smarties for buttons."
