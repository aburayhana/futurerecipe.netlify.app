Put another batch in the oven &amp; repeat until all mix is used up..."
- "At this point you can dust them with powdered sugar &amp; eat them if you&#39;d like... Otherwise put about 1/2 of your bag of chocolate chips in a bowl with your wax then into the microwave on low setting until melted... (I use a paring knife to shave the wax so that it melts better) After the chocolate is melted dip each macaroon into the chocolate &amp; shake off excess... Put back onto plate or platter &amp; into the freezer or fridge so the chocolate sets..."
- "Now you can eat them, share them or store them in airtight containers! I hope you all enjoy them! They are delicious &amp; addicting!!"
