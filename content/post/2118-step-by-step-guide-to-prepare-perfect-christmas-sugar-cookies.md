- "Stir in flour. Mix well but work the dough as little as possible. Over mixing makes cookies hard or tough."
- "Option 1 - Put dough into a cookie press and press onto cookie sheet. Bake at 400 until firm but try to remove before edges start to turn brown."

- "Tip: If you prefer a soft cookie, place cookies in a sealed container (or even a zip lock) and place a piece of white bread in the container (two for a larger container). This makes all the difference in the world for all cookies I have made! If you prefer a crisper cookie you can leave the cookies in for an extra minute and do not use the bread."
